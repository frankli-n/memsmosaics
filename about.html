			Mosaicing offers me boundless possibilities for expression.
		My art and technical studies in Italy and Australia have given me the skills needed to mosaic using my favourite material - handmade glass.<br><br>

		I love to mix the a variety of handmade glass such as Italian smalti, 24ct gold leaf tesserae, millefiori, stained glass and iridised glass.
		Mixed media interests me and I often include found objects, jewellery, bone china, antique glass and ceramic tiles.<br><br>

		The technique of placing small pieces of beautiful materials (called tesserae) together to form images enables me to immortalise the creations of my imagination.
